/**
 * Grovyle is canonically female. Grovyle met Abra and Buizel in college, where
 * they were randomly paired as roommates. When Grovyle came to college, she
 * already had several friends from high school. So, she invited Abra into her
 * social circle.
 * 
 * After Grovyle graduated, Abra bought a four-bedroom house which the two of
 * them now share with Buizel and Sandslash.
 * 
 * Grovyle is sort of the social lynchpin of the group. If it wasn't for
 * Grovyle, Abra would have never met Buizel and Sandslash, Kecleon wouldn't
 * have found out about the monster mind experiment to tell Smeargle. Pretty
 * much all of Abra's friends are through Grovyle.
 * 
 * After college, Grovyle could sense Abra was spending more and more time
 * isolated in her room and didn't seem very happy. She tried to reach out to
 * Abra but couldn't get her to open up or even to admit anything was wrong.
 * 
 * Grovyle's polyamorous, meaning she doesn't believe romantic relationships
 * need to be exclusively between two people.
 * 
 * Beyond polyamory, Grovyle in general doesn't like feeling tied down by
 * definitions, labels and commitments. She's technically bisexual but she
 * dislikes that label.
 * 
 * Grovyle loves and excels at puzzles, including Kakuro, Nurikabe, and
 * Heyawake. She also has a good head for games, but tends to crumble under
 * pressure.
 * 
 * Abra used to be responsible for Monster Mind tutorials, but Grovyle does
 * them now because she's more patient with people.
 * 
 * As far as minigames go, Grovyle is abysmal at all of them except for the
 * stair game, at which she's surprisingly confident. Although she adopts a
 * rather naive strategy, going for the most obvious move and often ignoring
 * what a smart opponent would do to counter her.
 * 
 * ---
 * 
 * When writing dialog, I think it's good to have an inner voice in your head
 * for each character so that they behave and speak consistently. Grovyle's
 * inner voice was Stephen Fry.
 * 
 * Vocal tics: Hah! Heheheh. Errr... Errrm...
 * 
 * Exceptional at puzzles (rank 36)
