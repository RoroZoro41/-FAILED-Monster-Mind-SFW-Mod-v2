/**
 * Buizel is canonically female. Buizel met Abra and Grovyle in college. Buizel
 * went to high school pretty far away, so she didn't have any friends, but
 * Grovyle helped her make friends. After college, they moved into a house
 * where they now live with Sandslash.
 * 
 * Buizel's a lesbian. Growing up in a small town there wasn't much of an LGBT
 * scene so she didn't date much. But, now she's looking to make up for lost
 * time.
 * 
 * Buizel startles easily.
 * 
 * Buizel and Grovyle are two of the few pokemon who wears clothing normally,
 * not just for the sake of the game. ...I guess maybe if you were Sandslash's
 * roommate you'd cover up too... ...
 * 
 * Buizel loves her parents and misses her friends from back home, but she's
 * much happier in the suburbs. She really hopes they'll some day move out
 * where she is so that she can see them again.
 * 
 * As far as minigames go, Buizel is terrible at them, and especially terrible
 * at the stair game. She always forgets about the bonus for rolling double
 * 0s, and ignores her opponent's motives.
 * 
 * ---
 * 
 * When writing dialog, I think it's good to have an inner voice in your head
 * for each character so that they behave and speak consistently. Buizel's
 * inner voice was Coach McGuirk from Home Movies.
 * 
 * Medium-bad at puzzles (Rank 13)
 * 
 * Vocal tics: Bwark! Bweh-heh-heh!
