/**
 * Heracross is canonically male. Heracross runs a shop in Abra's basement.
 * 
 * Heracross gouges the player for money so that the player will stick around
 * to solve more puzzles, and buy more items from the shop. He knows if the
 * player buys every last item, he will have no reason to keep playing the game.
 * 
 * Heracross is single and he is sometimes nervous about where his life is
 * headed if he continues being single as he grows older. But he tries not to
 * obsess over it.
 * 
 * Heracross has a tendency to develop a crush on anybody who shoots him the
 * slightest glimmer of attention, including the player.
 * 
 * After playing a minigame, Heracross will let people into his backroom where
 * they can practice that minigame with the last Pokemon they played with. He
 * will usually charge about $200, but if you want to play with Heracross, he
 * will charge you almost nothing.
 * 
 * Heracross wanted to be a part of the puzzle-solving stuff to spend more time
 * with the player, but Abra required him to get familiar with the puzzles
 * first. Heracross studied the puzzles extensively, and is now incredibly
 * skilled at them. With a whopping rank of 42, he is the most talented puzzle
 * solver than Abra himself.
 * 
 * Heracross was responsible for installing cameras throughout Abra's house
 * (with Abra's blessing.)
 * 
 * As far as the shop goes, Heracross's prices fluctuate. Each item has a base
 * price, so some items such as the insulated gloves are naturally very cheap
 * (about $150) and others such as the big red dildo are very expensive (about
 * $6,000).
 * 
 * As the player solves puzzles, additional items will become available in the
 * shop. He will only ever sell five items at once, because that is all that
 * can fit on his table.
 * 
 * If his shop is ever full, he will put two of them on "sale" -- one for very
 * very expensive, and one for very very cheap. If the player does not purchase
 * the items, they will go back into his stockroom.
 * 
 * As far as minigames go, Heracross practiced the minigames extensively,
 * particularly the scale game as he could practice it alone. With the scale
 * game in particular, it takes him a moment to parse the numbers but after
 * that initial delay he is incredibly fast at coming up with a solution. He is
 * awful at the stair game, it is possible his empathy with the bugs prevents
 * him from playing optimally... ...
 * 
 * ---
 * 
 * When writing dialog, I think it's good to have an inner voice in your head
 * for each character so that they behave and speak consistently. Heracross's
 * inner voice was a combination of Magic Man from Adventure Time, and Butters
 * from South Park.
 * 
 * Vocal tics:
 *  - Wowee! Gosh! Gweh-heh-heh! Yay! Yippee! Heracroosss!
 *  - Gwuhh... Err... Ehh...
 *  - Hey! Gwehhh! Gwehhh...
 *  - Oh my days! Oh my word! Oh my goodness gracious! Oh my land! What in the f-... funny business!?
 *  - Uses your name a lot
 * 
 * Exceptional at puzzles (rank 42)
