/**
 * Grimer is canonically female. Abra invited her over to her house a few
 * times, because she feels pity for grimer because Grimer doesn't have many
 * friends. Abra feels empathy for this, because as she feels herself growing
 * more distant from her friends -- she realizes some day she might end up sort
 * of like Grimer. Since then, Grimer has continued inviting herself over. Abra
 * tolerates her coming over, but can't stand the smell. She usually locks
 * herself in her room when she anticipates a visit.
 * 
 * Abra and the crew are sort of Grimer's best friends, but she's not their
 * best friend.
 * 
 * Grimer knows she smells bad so she tries not to come over very often.
 * 
 * If you buy her a gift he'll come over more. You first have to feed her a
 * dildo (the translucent green one) or the anal beads (the small purple ones)
 * and then wait for her to show up again, and she'll be apologetic. She's not
 * always hungry -- her "toy meter" has to be in the yellow zone. This is
 * influenced by incense if you want to make her hungry more often
 * 
 * If she eats an item, she'll reimburse you about 50% more than you paid for
 * the item, so you can earn a little extra money this way. But, if you keep on
 * feeding her, she'll catch on and realize it's not an accident! But she'll
 * still eat~
 * 
 * As far as minigames go, Grimer is pretty good at the stair game, but she'll
 * never pick "1" for the odds and evens game. So you can always go first if
 * you pick 1. She's pretty bad at both of the other minigames. Her goopy hands
 * make it hard for her to manipulate the bugs.
 * 
 * ---
 * 
 * When writing dialog, I think it's good to have an inner voice in your head
 * for each character so that they behave and speak consistently. Grimer's
 * inner voice was Rocky Robinson from The Adventures Of Gumball. (Or Bert from
 * Sesame Street.)
 * 
 * Vocal tics: Gwohohohoho! Gwohh-hohohohoh! Gwohohohorf~
 * Awkward pauses: glarp, barp, glop, blop, gloop, bloop, glurp, blorp, etc...
 * 
 * What does Grimer smell like?
 *  * (is someone cooking soup?)
 *  * (burnt popcorn)
 *  * (someone left a curling iron on?)
 *  * (can someone take out the garbage?)
 *  * (spilled vinegar)
 *  * bad milk or good cheese
 *  - pot smoke
 *  * fresh mulch
 * 
 * Weird body parts?
 *  - globular peptic ventricle
 *  - thiolic artery (ok)
 *  - jejunal bulb (bad)
 *  - mercaptanary polyp (bad)
 *  - orbicular phlegm valve (good)
 *  - pharynic cavity (good)
 *  - salivary lumpus (good)
 *
 * Goo puns:
 *  - (Way to goo)
 *  - (Goo morning, Goo afternoon, Goo evening)
 *  - (Goo job)
 * 
 * Abysmal at puzzles (rank 9)
