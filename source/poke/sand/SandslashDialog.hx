/**
 * Sandslash is canonically male. He made his debut in the Rhydon/Quilava
 * comic. He is a pervert with a heart of gold who always looks out for his
 * friends even when he is not having sex with them. (But he is usually having
 * sex with them.)
 * 
 * Sandslash moved in with Abra and her friends after college. Grovyle, Abra
 * and Buizel already knew each other from college. Abra was looking for
 * someone to fill an empty room, and Sandslash was looking for a cheap place
 * to live. Sandslash and Abra are basically acquaintances who tolerate each
 * other, not close friends.
 * 
 * Most of the time Sandslash is not at Abra's house, he is at the nearby "gym"
 * which is really just a place Pokemon go to hook up.
 * 
 * Sandslash is basically bisexual, although he'd describe himself as
 * "omnisexual." If it moves, he wants to have sex with it.
 * 
 * Sandslash 100% respects rules of fidelity and consent, and wants to ensure
 * sex is a positive force in people's lives. He has occasionally disrupted
 * relationships when other Pokemon were not honest with him -- such as an
 * incident involving his friends Scrafty and Krokorok.
 * 
 * Sandslash will occasionally show up wearing a ball gag. There is a muffled
 * dialog sequence where he explains that Abra's mortgage payments have
 * ballooned drastically since purchasing the house, and Sandslash is unsure
 * whether it is because of a predatory loan or whether that sort of thing is
 * normal.
 * 
 * Sandslash actually enjoys Grimer's smell, it makes him hornier. You will get
 * more money for Sandslash's videos if you play with Grimer before him.
 * 
 * As far as minigames go, Sandslash is abysmal at all of them, they do not
 * interest him. He is highly adaptable at the tug-of-war game and will react
 * quickly if you try to move your guys to counter him. But, he does not count
 * very quickly and sucks at math, so he will usually react in a dumb way.
 * 
 * ---
 * 
 * When writing dialog, I think it's good to have an inner voice in your head
 * for each character so that they behave and speak consistently. Sandslash's
 * inner voice was Craig Robinson
 * 
 * Vocal tics: Heh! Heh. Uhh...
 * 
 * So-so at puzzles (rank 22)
