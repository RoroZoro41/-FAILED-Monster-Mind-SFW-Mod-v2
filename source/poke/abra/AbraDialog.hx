/**
 * Abra met Grovyle and Buizel in college, and bought a four-bedroom house
 * shortly after graduating. She lives with Grovyle, Buizel and Sandslash.
 * 
 * Grovyle and Abra were randomly paired as roommates. Abra is naturally
 * introverted, but Grovyle helped her open up for awhile.
 * 
 * Buizel attended the same college as Abra, and they became friends. Abra
 * could sort of relate to Buizel's "fish out of water" discomfort of attending
 * college far away from home, because Abra's never really felt at home
 * anywhere.
 * 
 * Sandslash simply answered a craigslist ad for a roommate. He was looking for
 * a cheap place to live and Abra undercharged, because she didn't particularly
 * need the money.
 * 
 * Being in college forced Abra to interact with people in simple ways like
 * attending class, going out to eat, or having a roommate. After graduation,
 * Abra inadvertently became more reclusive, as things like food and work could
 * be handled remotely, and she had her own bedroom. This wore down on her over
 * time and she became depressed and created Monster Mind as a way of
 * addressing her depression.
 * 
 * Depending on the actions chosen by the player in MonsterMind, Abra either
 * swaps consciousnesses and adapts to human life, or overcomes her depression
 * by realizing she's not alone in the universe, and that she's surrounded by
 * friends who care about her even when she pushes them away.
 * 
 * Abra designed MonsterMind as a way of finding a good match for her
 * consciousness swap. She needed someone with a not-too-smart not-too-dumb
 * kind of brain, so she came up with the puzzles to measure. She also needed
 * someone who would be happy in the body of a Pokemon, which is why the game
 * targets poke-perverts.
 * 
 * If you go through her 5-peg puzzle tutorial, (which is a completely
 * unhelpful joke tutorial,) Abra will introduce you to the idea of 7-peg
 * puzzles. After finishing the 7-peg puzzle, further puzzles can be selected
 * from the main menu by clicking her head. 7-peg puzzles do not offer any
 * gameplay reward, but Abra gets off on watching you struggle with them.
 * 
 * Abra is far more intelligent than anybody else in the house, and is fully
 * aware of it. She often comes across as arrogant or demeaning. Over the
 * course of the game, she tries to get better about masking this but it's
 * difficult for her.
 * 
 * As far as minigames go, Abra basically plays all three games perfectly. She
 * solves the scale puzzles instantly, but it still takes her several seconds
 * to move the bugs to the scales, so she can be beaten if you are more
 * dextrous than her. She deliberately adopts a suboptimal strategy to the
 * stair game in an effort to "out-think" the player.
 * 
 * ---
 * 
 * When writing dialog, I think it's good to have an inner voice in your head
 * for each character so that they behave and speak consistently. Abra's
 * inner voice was Starscream or sometimes Invader Zim.
 * 
 * Always referencing her IQ, which fluctuates between 600 and 900
 * 
 * Vocal tics: Eeh-heheheh! Bahahahaha
 * 
 * Ludicrously good at puzzles (10x as fast as rank 65)
